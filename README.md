# daryl
Daryl is a performant and opinionated [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme. It aims to be simply designed, single-column and above-all, highly-readable. The name of this theme is from [Daryl Dixon](http://walkingdead.wikia.com/wiki/Daryl_Dixon_(TV_Series)), of the Walking Dead. 

It's not ready for release yet, but is actively being developed. 

## What this theme will be:

- Mobile-first and by nature, performant-first
- Responsive by default
- Small file size
- No Sass/Less. Vanilla HTML and CSS.

## Development

Daryl’s *Master* branch is the “clean branch”. *Master* is ready to be deployed at all times once this theme is released. All development will be done on their own branches in a SEMVER style. If a patch or feature needs to be pushed to _Master_, a 1.1.0 (for feature) or 1.0.1 (for a patch/fix) will be created and developed on. 

Since this is an open source project, pull requests for fixes are welcome. If you would like to change the design of this theme, you can fork this project.

## License

This theme is open sourced under the [MIT license](https://github.com/andrewcodes/daryl/blob/gh-pages/LICENSE).
