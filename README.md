# daryl
Daryl is a performant and responsive [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme. It aims to be simply designed and above-all, highly-readable. This is a screenshot of the Daryl theme as it stands now:

## This theme is:

- Mobile-first and by nature, performant-first
- Responsive by default
- Small file size
- No Sass/Less. Vanilla HTML and CSS.
- Includes an Archive/Post-list page template.

## Development

Daryl’s *Master* branch is the “clean branch”. *Master* is ready to be deployed at all times once this theme is released. All development will be done on their own branches in a SEMVER style. If a patch or feature needs to be pushed to _Master_, a 1.1.0 (for feature) or 1.0.1 (for a patch/fix) will be created and developed on.

Since this is an open source project, pull requests for fixes are welcome. If you would like to change the design of this theme, you can fork this project.
