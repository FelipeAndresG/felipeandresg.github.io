Hi there, thanks for checking out Daryl, a performant and simple theme for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I designed this theme to be as readable as possible, to be simple to use, and to keep the code used as vanilla as possible.

It's open source for a reason: I've learned a lot from open source software and I'm trying to give a little something back. Hope you enjoy. Here there is an equation following

$$ P(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma ^2}} $$

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\\]
